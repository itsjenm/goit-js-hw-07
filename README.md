# Task 1 - Image Gallery 
Created a gallery with the ability to click on its items and view full size images in a modal window.

## Steps 
*1.* Creating and rendering markup from the ```galleryItems``` data array and provided gallery item template. 
*2.* Implementing delegation to ```div.gallery``` and getting the ```url``` of a large image. 
*3.* Adding the script and styles of the modal window library basicLightBox. Used the jsdelivrCDN service to add links to minified. ```.min``` library files to the project. 
*4.* Opening a modal window by clicking on a gallery item. 
*5.* Replacing the value of the ```src``` attribute of the ```<img>``` element in a modal window before opening.
